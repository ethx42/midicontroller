# Custom MIDI Controller with Teensy 3.6

Welcome to the home of the Custom MIDI Controller, crafted specifically for enthusiasts and professionals seeking to bridge the gap between creativity and technology. Utilizing the robust [Teensy 3.6 development board](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy36.html), this project transforms your conventional approach to audiovisual productions by turning analog inputs into versatile MIDI signals, compatible with a wide array of audio and video software and hardware.

## Features and Highlights

- **Easy Integration**: Designed for seamless compatibility with the Teensy 3.6 board.
- **Customizable Controls**: Utilize ten 50 kOhm potentiometers to craft your unique sound. You can replace them with oscilloscopes, gyroscopes, faders, etc.
- **Versatile Application**: Perfect for DJs, VJs, audiovisual producers, and live performers looking to enhance their setup.
- **Open Source**: Modify and share your version with the community.
